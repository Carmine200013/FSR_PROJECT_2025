# FSR_PROJECT_2025

Open the Simulink file "geometric\_control\_load.slx".

Choose the type of trajectory to execute by setting the value of the variable `type_traj`, located in *Model Properties -> InitFcn*:

* If `type_traj = 0` → elliptical trajectory
* If `type_traj = 1` → multi-frequency trajectory

Then run the Simulink file.
To generate animations and plots, run the corresponding MATLAB script ("Plot\_UAV\_Load.m")
